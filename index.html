                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>
                            Hello, my name is Luis Westberry, a former landscape contractor looking to 
                            change industries, who lives in the Houston TX area. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I've always been interested in computers but never thought the industry 
                            was accessible to me, with codecademy's help I plan to get into a coding
                            bootcamp, namely flatiron, to hopefully land me my first job as a junior 
                            front end web developer by this time next year (current date: 05/14/2023).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In what free time I do have I usaully am either working out or looking into more 
                            stuff in relation to coding, sense it has become a main point of focus for me for the 
                            better part of seven months now.
                        </p>
